Scraper built to retrieve all verdicts from the Colombian Constitutional Court since its beginnings in 1992 until today.
The scraper is called 'sentspider.py' and can be executed everytime, including a -o filename.json option in the command line to output all the text data from the visited URLs.
(Excuse the non-pythonic way to present the 26 start-urls: suggestions on the topic more than welcomed!)
